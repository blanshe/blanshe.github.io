# How US is Losing Africa Market to China
This project examined export trade volume between Africa and China and Africa and Africa with USA. It examined expport value from 1992 to 2018. 

The project is published here; (https://blanshe.github.io/portfolio/trade.html). The product is a mix of d3 and datawrapper charts. 

I drew drew data from the US Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c0019.html) and John Hopkins University based China Africa Research Institute (http://www.sais-cari.org/data-china-africa-trade)

# Detailed Analysis 

This project has no analysis notebook because I organised my data in excel. And from excel I exported to datawrapper and d3 where visualizations were made.
