    <p>Trade statistics show that by 2015, China earned almost $9 for every dollar that U.S earned from exports to Africa. This is revealing of the extent to which China has captured the African market.</p>
    <p>China’s top exports to Africa include machinery, electronics and textiles.  And its top imports are crude oil, iron ore, cotton and other natural resources. South Africa, Angola and Nigeria are its biggest trading partners on the continent.</p>
    <p>The surge in China-Africa trade volume has been bolstered by export credit facilitation that Africa importers receive from Chinese government owned banks. The Brookings in 2018 reported that China has been awarding import credit worth $35 billion annually to African importers or Chinese companies exporting goods to Africa.</p>

    <p>But much of Africa-China trade and diplomatic relationship has been defined by the latter’s investment in the former. From 2000 to 2017, the Chinese government, banks and contractors extended US $143 billion in loans to African governments and their state-owned enterprises (SOEs), according to CARI report. Angola is the top recipient of Chinese loans, with $42.8 billion disbursed over 17 years.</p>
    <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping, last year while opening Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, said China will invest more $60 billion in Africa. This will include $15 billion of aid, interest-free loans and concessional loans, a credit line of $20 billion, a $10 billion special fund for China-Africa development, and a $5 billion special fund for imports from Africa.</p>
    <p>Transport, power and mining top sectors where Chinese loans have been invested in Africa, according to a CARI data base.</p>
