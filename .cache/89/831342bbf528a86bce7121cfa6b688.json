Like Rats: How Often Do They Complain?</h1>\n      <h2 class=\"subhead\">It’s said that rats have lived in New York since 1750s. City administrations has been aggressively trying to get rid of rats for centuries. Its not yet over. A public rat sight complaint data-set created in 2010 offers a glimpse of how New Yorkers complain about rats.</h2>\n      <p class=\"byline\">\n              <a href=\"http://jonathansoma.com/\"> MUSINGUZI BLANSHE</a>\n      </p>\n          <p class=\"date\">Published December 10th, 2019</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <main id=\"content\">\n\n    <!-- \n  This line means, use default.hbs layout from src/html/layouts/\n-->\n\n<div class=\"story-body\">\n    <p>The data-set doesn’t tell a complete story of New York rat problem. It’s simply shows places where people are likely to pick up a phone, dial 311 and report a complaint. No research has been done as to why some people report rats more than other.</p>\n    <p>Actually, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/nyregion/8-million-rats-in-new-york-data-suggest-that-legend-is-flawed.html\">Jonathan Auerbach</a>, a doctorate at Columbia University, in 2014 authored a paper which showed that there could be less rats in areas where most complaints come from. His paper won a competition sponsored by the 180-year-old Royal Statistical Society of London.</p>\n    <p>A department of public health and mental hygiene spokesperson says after a complaint is logged, “we send an inspector to perform an inspection at that address. Inspectors look for signs of rat activity, like burrows or rat droppings, and order the property owner to remediate the conditions we find.”</p>\n    <p> Following this initial inspection, the complaint is logged as “closed,” however a second inspection of the property is carried out to ensure its in compliance. “If rat activity is found on reinspection, we issue summonses and will often treat the property with our own extermination staff.” </p>\n    <p> There are two complaints from Brooklyn for almost every complaint that come from other boroughs, except Staten Island that represent a complaint per seven complaints. </p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"story-body\">\n\n  <h3></h3>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <div id=\"chart-8\"></div>\n  \n  <script src=\"/4bc87209e3f5fc8f1541ec9552e42cea.js\"></script></div>\n\n<div class=\"story-body\">\n <p> This means more folk in Brooklyn complain about rats when data is zoomed in to zip code level.
