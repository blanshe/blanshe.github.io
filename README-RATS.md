# Rats Compalaints in New York 
In this project, I am using the New York rat complaints database to visualize the rate at which New Yorkers complain of rats in their area. This (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Rat-Sightings/3q43-55fe) data-set was created in 2010 and it has entries such as date of sight, zip code, borough, latitude, longitude, among. 

# What patterns I am I looking for?
In data analysis (https://github.com/blanshe/NY-RATS/blob/master/rat_in_NY/Rat_in_NY.ipynb, I am looking at patterns such as aggregate reported complaints per borough, varriance in borough complaints per year, varriance in zip codes per year, aggregate complaints per zip code, among others. 

# What visualisations?
A d3 map of New York boroughs showing aggregate rat sight complaints 
Map of New York zip codes showing aggregate rat sight per zip code. 
A multi-level pie chart showing varriance in Boroughs over years. 
A search where a person can enter a zip code and get to know how many times rat complaints have come from its residents. 

# What's next?
Building a block after block. I will be updating this file...
